			While the MTA announced an increase in its subway and local bus fares to an even three dollars by January of next year, transit riders are left wondering where their fare is even going.
		</p>

    <p>
      Despite a fare increase in August of 2023, the time that customer's arrive on time to their stop based on bus performances systemwide has steadily remained the same over the years across the five boroughs. New York City Comptroller Brad Lander recently released <a href="https://comptroller.nyc.gov/reports/life-in-the-slow-lane/#findings">a report</a> stating that buses across the city perform at a below-average standard based on the review of bus riders.

				According to the MTA's website, <a href="https://www.mta.info/fares-tolls/2025-changes">fares and tolls</a> provide the MTA with “resources to operate a safe and reliable transportation system that New Yorkers can count on.” Data shows that <a href="https://metrics.mta.info/?ridership/daybydayridershipnumbers">an average of a million people</a> utilize the various bus services offered by the MTA daily since August 2023.
      </p>

      <p>
      	Even with its large daily ridership, some New Yorkers do not feel that promised reliability.
			</p>

			<p>
				“I definitely plan when I take the bus because it can be pretty slow,” said Maggie Gilmartin, a Manhattan University graduate student. “If it’s running late, it can definitely mess up my schedule which can be really frustrating.”
			</p>

			<p>
				Gilmartin rides the Bx9 which is the one of the local buses with the highest riderships in the Bronx. However, while many rely on this form of public transportation, it has one of the lower on-time performance rates compared to other buses in the borough.

			<p>
				Bus riders like Gilmartin utilize public transit to get from place to place. However, due to unreliable service, riders need to plan their days around their bus ride.
			</p>

			<p>
				In 2022, the MTA made <a href="https://www.mta.info/budget/MTA-operating-budget-basics#:~:text=The%20MTA's%20Operating%20Budget%20funds,by%20the%20MTA's%20Capital%20Budget.">$6.8 billion</a> from fares and tolls combined. Even though fares bring in a large sum, transit users are left standing at their bus stop hoping their bus comes soon.
			</p>

			<p>
				However, Danny Pearlstein, a member of the Riders Alliance organization which advocates for a more affordable and reliable transit system, stated that the fare is one of the most commonly confused aspects of the MTA.
			</p>

			<p>
				 "The fare is used as revenue to keep public transit running," Pearlstein explained. "It does not go towards the overall improvement of the system."
			</p>

			<p>
				From funding employee salaries to fuel and electricity for vehicles, the Riders Alliance member explained that the fare goes towards the day-to-day costs of operating transportation, but that major system improvements come from other avenues such as donor support.
			</p>

			<p>
				However, the Riders Alliance member expressed that “the fare is the most regressive way to raise funds for public transit”, explaining that the primary group funding that fare are working class New Yorkers that may not be able to afford the extra expense.

	</p>

	  <p>
	  	However, Pearlstein noted that people may have more difficulty in paying their fare due to the MTA's unreliable services.

		<p>
			Pearlstein believes that reforms need to be done to the MTA's system to create a more accessible and reliable experience for all riders. However, he expressed that the reforms needed cannot be accomplished just through fare payments.
		</p>

		<p>
			“It will take a lot of funds and a lot of time,” Pearstein said. “It's a big and bitter fight between the people in power and people who are actually using public transit.”
